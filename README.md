### Background
The game is called AI takeover. The goal of the game is to survive the apocalypse where robots have taken over the city of San Francisco. The objective is to survive for as many rounds as possible as the number of robots increases. 
Use your ‘wasd’ keys to move around while clicking on the robots to eliminate them. 


### Functionality & MVPs
Users will be able to: 
- Aim up, down, and 360 degrees using their mouse.
- Move within the restricted boundaries using the ‘wasd’ keys
- See their scores increase as a robot is killed
- See the level increase along with the number of robots increase in relation to the level

- User controls the player model and attempts to eliminate computer models
- Score on the top right will increase as the number of computers eliminated increases
- Round # will increase after player eliminates all the computer models in a given round


### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
- Three.js for creating 3D objects (robots, gun)
- Ammo.js for bullet physics



### Implementation Timeline
- Friday afternoon Setup project, figure out and implement mouse movement logic.
- Saturday: Complete mouse movement logic and implement movement logic using ‘wasd’ keys.
- Sunday: Create logic for AI robots 
- Monday: Implement score system as well as implementing a timer 
- Tuesday: Create different levels
- Wednesday: Make visual changes to make the game more aesthetic. Including adding a menu as well as a functioning start button. Also a “game over” and “next level” pop up messages. 


### Bonus Features
- Implement ammo counter to reload 
- Add flying computer models to increase difficulty for higher levels 
- Add different maps for different levels
