### Background
The goal of Zombie Run is to survive the apocalypse where zombies have taken over the courtyard. The objective is to survive for as many levels as possible as the number of zombies increase. 
Use your ‘wasd’ keys to move around while clicking on the zombies to eliminate them. 

There are two modes: an easy and a hard mode. In easy mode, the speed and damage of the zombies are decreased while the player's rate of fire is increased. In addition, the red zombies won't shoot at you. In hard mode, the speed and damage of the zombies are increased, while the player's rate of fire are decreased. In addition, the red zombies do shoot at you.

The red zombies are the slowest and will award the player with 10 points when killed. Keep in mind, in the hard mode they have the ability to shoot at players and if hit, will deduct 5 hp points from the player. The speed of the zombies increase respectively with the blue awarding 20 points, the black 30 points, and the green 50 points. 


### Functionality & MVPs
Users will be able to: 
- Aim 360 degrees using the player's mouse
- Move within the restricted boundaries using the ‘wasd’ keys
- See player's scores increase as a zombie is killed
- See player's health decrease as they are within the bounds of the zombie
- See player's health decrease by 5 if they are shot with a blue bullet from a zombie
- See the level increase along with the number of zombies/speed of zombies increase in relation to the level
